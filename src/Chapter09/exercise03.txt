My experiences on both have been quite similar. Similar speed (the CRH used to reach 350 km/h but this was brought down to 300), similar smoothness, both very comfortable. The main difference (again, my experience only) is CRH trains being more crowded and noisy (noise generated by people, not the train).

For safety, the Shinkansen has a spotless record while the CRH has had one major crash, with 40 casualties. The Shinkansen has been operating longer but as of 2015 has a network almost 10 times smaller than the CRH (List of high-speed rail lines), so I could imagine that the number of cumulative passenger-kilometers traveled on the CRH is now higher than the Shinkansen. I do not think it's possible to extract statistically significant patterns from so few incidents.

Generally, I believe the CRH is cheaper per kilometer traveled, as is generally the case when it comes to transportation in China vs Japan.
